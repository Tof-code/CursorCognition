- Fix inconsistencies in module interactions

### 🧠 Rules & reasoning
- Add useful `.mdc` rules under `.cursor/rules/`
- Propose new masks, naming conventions, or abstraction policies
- Contribute templates for reusable decision-making

### 🧪 TDD specs
- Contribute new `spec_step_{x}.md` examples
- Suggest real-world cases to expand test-first logic
- Improve how CursorCognition formulates and explains test specs

## 🚦 Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a new branch: `feature/your-topic`
3. Make your changes with clarity and modularity in mind
4. Commit with clear messages (see below)
5. Open a Pull Request with context and intention

---

## 🧾 Commit Message Guidelines

Use semantic commit messages when possible:

```
feat: add new abstraction trigger in Φ module
doc: clarify TDD loop interaction in trace.md
fix: correct mask naming pattern in rules.md
refactor: simplify memory append logic in M module
test: add edge case spec for date sorter
```

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Every module should be **autonomous yet composable**
- Every change should serve **cognitive clarity**
- TDD is the **first step, not an afterthought**
- Memory (`M`) and Trace (`Ψ`) are **the source of future evolution**

> CursorCognition learns by doing — but also by remembering how it learned.

---

## 🧩 Open Questions / Areas to Explore

- Multi-agent coordination between specialized modules
- Visual representations of Ψ.trace and reasoning graphs
- Language-specific adaptations (e.g. Pythonic reasoning, TypeScript TDD)
- Plugin architecture for domain-specific reasoning
